## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You found my github profile. That's great! Allow me to introduce myself:

I'm Fernando Crozetta, a software engineer from BrazilðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· (living in the Netherlands), and I found my passion in coding âŒ¨. I develop mostly back end, but i have done some mobile apps, front end as well.

I'm willing to work on any project that catches my curiosity.
